    <h1>Happy 100th day of our Love and I miss you Punya❤️</h1>
    <div class="message-container">

Hey Punya, my sweetheart 💑,

From the moment our paths crossed on that unforgettable trek ⛰️, you've held a space in my heart no one else ever could ❤️. You're the most beautiful-hearted soul I've ever met — kind, warm, gentle, and real 🌟. I fell for you, not just because of how you look or speak, but because of the love that shines through your soul ✨. Since the day I met you… I've loved you. Deeply. Quietly. And endlessly 💕.

You may not know this, but the day I realized how much you truly love me… I married you in my heart 💍. Since then, every smile, every word from you, every little gesture — it has meant the world to me 🌎. And while time has passed and things have changed, my feelings for you haven't 🔒.

Lately, I've felt a shift… like there's some distance between us 🌊. Maybe I'm overthinking, maybe I'm just missing you too much 💭. But I feel it — in the silence, in the gaps, in the spaces where your voice and presence used to be 👂. And I just want to say this, from the deepest part of me:

I notice. I feel. I care. 💗

I'm not dumb to miss the little changes in our relationship 👀. I feel every moment when you're not as present, every time the energy between us fades for a second. And it hurts… not because I blame you, but because I care so much 💔.

All I want is us — strong, together, vulnerable, and honest 🤝. I want us to fight for each other no matter what 🛡️. I'm not asking for perfection, just for effort. I need to feel your presence again — the way you used to talk to me, share with me, laugh with me 😊. I know life gets busy… but when you love someone, you make time. You find ways 🕰️. Even a little text, even a simple "I'm thinking of you" makes all the difference 📱💌.

Please don't let negative thoughts or overthinking build a wall between us 🧱. Whatever doubts or fears are in your heart, let me hold them with you 🫂. We don't need to have it all figured out — we just need to promise that we'll walk through it together 👣. And I promise you this: no matter what life throws at us, I'll be by your side, as your man, your partner, your future husband 👨‍❤️‍👩.

I'm craving your presence, your time, your love 🥺. I miss you so much — even a single day without hearing from you feels incomplete 📅. I just want to hold your hand, look into your eyes, and tell you everything I've been holding in 👁️👁️.

You're such a kind, beautiful soul, Punya… and I love you. Genuinely, truly, forever 🌹.

I know we're meant to be ✨. I just want to feel that we're still choosing each other every single day — not out of habit, but out of love 💖.

So please… just meet me once 🙏. Let's talk, let's reconnect, let's feel each other again ✨.

Because I'm here, wholeheartedly… always 🌈.
      <p>Your faith, your love, your lovable 🦁</p>
